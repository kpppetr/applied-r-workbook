## About this course

The objective of this course is to introduce students to the statistical concepts and programming skills required to analyze event-based and spatial data related to migration, disasters, and conflict.

The course emphasizes practical engagement with real-world datasets, enabling students to explore how human mobility, environmental crises, and political instability interact and shape global and regional dynamics.

Throughout the workbook, students will learn how to:

- import and manage data  
- clean and transform datasets  
- summarize and aggregate information  
- merge multiple data sources  
- reshape data between wide and long formats  
- conduct basic exploratory analysis  

The focus is on building a strong applied foundation in R that supports independent empirical research.
